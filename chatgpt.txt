--- Create Main App (Note: has bugs) ---
Create react app;
use material ui;

Have styles in each component;
use a theme across all components;
theme should have three colours and two standard font styles;
primary colour is blue, secondary colour is dark grey, and third colour is light grey;
Use “useStyles” for the theme;

app is a marketplace;
the app should be responsive;
the app should have a header;
the header should have a logo in the top left and a menu in the top right;
the header should have three main clickable links;
three tabs are available in the header: marketplace, search, login;
show sample code for each tab;
each tab is a separate component;
the app has a tile for each product in the marketplace;
list of products in the marketplace are obtained using GET "/products", use popular http library to fetch data;
use grids for tiles in marketplace;
each tile is a separate component;
when tile is clicked show a product view component;
product view component is a separate component;
product view data is obtained using GET "/products/{uuid}", use popular http library to fetch data;
each product view has several fields: name, description, tags
each field in product view has a field name and a field value;
field name is all upper case, but 0.75 size of regular font, and secondary colour;
field values are regular size and primary colour;
each product view component has a routable page and link;
the header, tiles, tabs, views, and marketplace should be components;
use router for each page;

--- Create MarketplaceComponent ---
using react and material ui;
create component called MarketplaceComponent;
MarketplaceComponent has a title "Marketplace"
MarketplaceComponent has many tiles in a grid;
make the grid containing products to be responsive
MarketplaceComponent gets data from GET "/products";
each returned product data has a name and description;
each product data is represented as a Card;
each product data card has a header with the name, and a text field containing the description;
each card has a clickable field titled "Choose" which when clicked will go to a ProductComponent;
all clickable fields should be uppercase using the secondary colour;

--- Create ProductComponent ---
using react and material ui;
I have an app defined in App.js
create component called ProductComponent called by the App;
an interface called Product contains a uuid, name, and description field
ProductComponent takes a single parameter, called product, which is of type Product
the product props should have an interface
ProductComponent shows text for the product's uuid field
